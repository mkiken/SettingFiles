description = "Analyzes PR review comments based on user instructions"
prompt = """Analyze PR review comments for {{args}}.

**Arguments**: The first token in {{args}} is the PR comment URL ($COMMENT_URL), and the rest are user instructions ($PROMPT).

**IMPORTANT**: Always respond in Japanese regardless of the original language of the PR content.

## Step 1: Parse the Comment URL

Extract the comment type and ID from $COMMENT_URL:
- If URL contains `#issuecomment-{id}` → Issue Comment (comment on PR as a whole)
- If URL contains `#discussion_r{id}` → Review Comment (comment on code lines)
- Extract `owner`, `repo`, and `pull_number` from the URL path (format: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{pull_number}#...`)

## Step 2: Fetch Baseline Data

First, run this command to fetch all PR comments as baseline:
!{gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --comments}

## Step 3: Fetch the Target Comment

During the conversation, you will need to execute the appropriate API call based on the parsed URL:

- For Issue Comment:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}
  ```
- For Review Comment:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}
  ```

Note: These dynamic API calls will require user confirmation during execution (Gemini CLI limitation).

## Step 4: Fetch Thread Context

For Review Comment, fetch full review thread:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments
```

Filter by `in_reply_to_id` to reconstruct thread containing target comment.

For Issue Comment, target is typically standalone.

## Step 5: Focused Analysis

Analyze primarily based on the **target comment** specified by the URL.
Use related comments only as supplementary context.

Output a detailed analysis in Japanese using the following structure:

### **Target Comment Details**

- **Author**: Comment author
- **Posted at**: Timestamp
- **Location**: Code location (for Review Comment: file path, line number)
- **Content**: Full comment text

### **Deep Analysis**

Based on $PROMPT, provide in-depth analysis of the target comment:

- Intent and purpose of the comment
- Detailed issues pointed out
- Technical background and reasoning
- Recommended response methods

### **Related Discussion**

- If there are comments in the same thread, summarize the discussion flow
- Clarify relationship to the target comment

### **Recommended Actions**

- Specific actions based on the target comment
- Priority and direction

### **Additional Notes**

- Other important information"""
