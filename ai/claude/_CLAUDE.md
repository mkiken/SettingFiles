# Command Usage
When using shell commands via Bash tool, be aware that this environment has command aliases that override standard commands:
- `ls` is aliased to `eza` (different options available)
- `cat` is aliased to `bat --style=plain` (different syntax)
- `rm` is aliased to `trash` (no -rf option, files go to trash)
- `df` is aliased to `duf` (different output format)
- `top` is aliased to `glances` (different interface)
- `wget` is aliased to `aria2c` (different options)
- `curl` is aliased to `https` (different syntax)
- `du` is aliased to `dust` (different options)

Always verify command compatibility or use full paths (e.g., `/bin/rm`) if standard behavior is required.
